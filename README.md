# DataForDemocracy-DataExploration
Exploratory Data Analysis - Data for Democracy Ideas

The purpose of this repository is to store data and code that allows me to explore ideas for Data for Democracy.

Some data I'm hoping to explore are ideological data, DC Crime Data for USA-Crime Dashboards, and Women's March Data.
